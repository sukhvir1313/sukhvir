test chrome extension

Scope of the test:
You should build a very simple Chrome Extension application which integrates Time Doctor web API into it. This is a paid test. We will pay for a maximum of 10 hours of work to do it.

The extension should be a little icon on the top right side of the chrome browser. Once clicked there should be a button called “authenticate”. Once you click the button it should do authentication as it’s described here:

https://webapi.timedoctor.com/doc/#authentication

Once the authentication is done and we have the user access token then we need to make this app simply
Listing all the users created in the company
Selecting the user and listing all his tasks

You can make that available with these two api calls:
https://webapi.timedoctor.com/doc/#users
https://webapi.timedoctor.com/doc/#tasks

Note: before that you should sign up on timedoctor.com in order to be able to login within the web api
https://webapi.timedoctor.com

You should provide us the access credentials for your Time Doctor account so we can test the whole process and review your application set up with our API.

The UI / UX can be very simple and clean, you can fully trust on your imagination and there are no restrictions on how it should be structured.
